# Job Application Form

This is a simple HTML form for job applications. The form is divided into several sections to collect different types of information from the applicant.

## Sections

1. **Personal Information**: This section collects basic information such as name, email, phone number, address, and city.

2. **Education Level**: This section asks the applicant to select their highest level of education from a dropdown menu.

3. **Work Experience**: This section asks the applicant to select their years of work experience from a dropdown menu.

4. **Job Position**: This section asks the applicant to select the job position they are applying for from a dropdown menu.

5. **Skills**: This section provides a text area for the applicant to list their skills.

6. **Resume Upload**: This section provides an option for the applicant to upload their resume. The file input accepts .pdf, .doc, and .docx files.

The form uses POST method to send form data to a server-side script (newform1.php). The form also includes a submit button for the applicant to submit their application.

## Usage

To use this form, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Fill out the form fields and click the "Submit" button to submit the form. The form data will be sent to the server-side script specified in the form's `action` attribute.

## Note
